## How Can I Contribute?

### Adding a New Skill

Skills are the core of Zeoel. Each skill is a structured SKILL.md file that teaches an AI agent how to perform a specific task.

**Steps:**

1. **Fork** the repository
2. **Create** your skill directory:
   ```
   skills/your-skill-name/SKILL.md
   ```
3. **Follow** the SKILL.md format:
   ```markdown
   ---
   name: your-skill-name
   description: >-
     One-line description of what this skill does.
   ---

   # Your Skill Name

   ## Overview
   What this skill enables and when to use it.

   ## Guidelines
   Step-by-step instructions the agent should follow.

   ## Examples
   Real-world usage examples.

   ## Anti-Patterns
   Common mistakes to avoid.
   ```
4. **Submit** a PR with the `new-skill` label

**Skill Quality Checklist:**
- [ ] Has a clear, descriptive name (use hyphens, lowercase)
- [ ] YAML frontmatter includes `name` and `description`
- [ ] Provides actionable instructions (not just documentation links)
- [ ] Includes at least 2 real examples
- [ ] Lists anti-patterns or common mistakes
- [ ] Works within the Zeoel agent dispatch protocol

### Adding a New Agent

Agents are specialized personas with curated skill bindings.

**Steps:**

1. Create a new folder under `agents/your-agent-name/`
2. Create two files: `agent.yml` (defining manifest metadata) and `SYSTEM.md` (defining system instructions)
3. Define the metadata in `agent.yml` following the Zod schema in [src/orchestrator/schema.ts](file:///Volumes/Mac/downloads/zeoel/src/orchestrator/schema.ts):
   - **id & name** — The agent's identifier and display name
   - **role** — The role designation
   - **preferred_engines & default_model** — LLM and routing configs
   - **skills** — Paths to skill files under `skills/`
   - **permissions** — Operations permissions (read_files, write_files, run_commands, etc.)
   - **memory** — Memory configurations, standardizing on the common `zeoeldb` scope.
4. Update `AGENTS.md` with the new agent entry
5. Submit a PR with the `new-agent` label

Found a skill that's outdated or could be better? We love improvements!

1. Check the skill's current content in `skills/[name]/SKILL.md`
2. Make your improvements (update patterns, add examples, fix errors)
3. Submit a PR explaining what you changed and why

### Reporting Bugs

Use the [Bug Report template](.github/ISSUE_TEMPLATE/bug_report.md) and include:
- Steps to reproduce
- Expected behavior
- Actual behavior
- Your environment (OS, AI tool used, version)

### Suggesting Features

Use the [Feature Request template](.github/ISSUE_TEMPLATE/feature_request.md) and describe:
- What problem the feature solves
- Your proposed solution
- Any alternatives you've considered

---

## Development Setup

```bash
# Clone the repo
git clone https://github.com/goharabbas321/zeoel.git
cd zeoel

# Test the init command locally
node bin/zeoel.js init

# Make your changes in agents/ or skills/
```

No build step is required — Zeoel is a file-based framework.

---

## Pull Request Process

1. **Branch** from `main` with a descriptive name: `skill/tailwindcss-v4` or `fix/readme-typo`
2. **Commit** with clear messages: `feat(skill): add tailwindcss-v4 patterns`
3. **Test** that `npx zeoel-ai init` still works
4. **Fill out** the PR template completely
5. **Wait** for review — we aim to respond within 48 hours

### Commit Message Format

## Style Guide

### SKILL.md Files
- Use title case for headings
- Use code blocks with language tags for all code examples
- Keep instructions actionable ("Do X" not "X could be done")
- Maximum 500 lines per SKILL.md (split into sub-files if larger)

### Agent Files
- Use the established persona format
- Always define primary (⭐) and secondary skills
- Include constraints and anti-patterns

### General
- Markdown files should pass basic linting
- Use relative links within the repo
- Keep line lengths reasonable (< 120 chars for prose)
