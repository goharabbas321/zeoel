Save as `docs/sprint-N/plan.md`:

```markdown
# Sprint N — [Name]

> Sprint Goal: [one sentence describing the deliverable]
> Branch: feature/sprint-N
> Estimated effort: [time estimate]

## Prioritized Task List

## What's NOT in This Sprint

| Feature | Reason | Priority | Target Sprint |
|---------|--------|----------|---------------|
| [cut feature] | [why — scope, complexity, not needed yet] | P1/P2/P3 | Sprint N+1 |

> These items MUST be copied to `docs/sprint-N/deferred.md` and `docs/deferred/backlog.md` at sprint start.

## Execution Dispatch Prompt

> Use `zeoel-dispatch` to execute this sprint.
>
> 1. For each task, load the assigned agent's context from `.agents/skills/zeoel/agents/[name].md`.
> 2. Complete the task AND its required tests using their bound skills.
> 3. Run the Post-Task Checkpoint (Step 7) — update `progress.md`, verify tests, log deferred items.
> 4. Every 3 tasks, run the Incremental Audit Check (Step 8).
> 5. Commit changes: `git commit -m "feat: [task description]"`
> 6. Move to the next task on the list.
```

## Document Existence Checklist

> Verify ALL mandatory documents at key checkpoints.
> Print this checklist: at sprint start, every 3 tasks, and before closing the sprint.
> This is NOT optional — it is a HARD-GATE verification.

### Sprint Start (Phase 2 → Phase 3 transition)

```
═══════════════════════════════════════════
  SPRINT START — DOCUMENT VERIFICATION

═══════════════════════════════════════════
  [ ] docs/sprint-N/progress.md      — all tasks ✅ or ⏭️
  [ ] docs/sprint-N/deferred.md      — updated (or "no items deferred")

═══════════════════════════════════════════
```

> If ANY item is ❌, complete it FIRST. The sprint is NOT done until all items are ✅.

## Progress Tracker

Create `docs/sprint-N/progress.md` at sprint start:

```markdown
# Sprint N — Progress Tracker

> If context overflows, start a new chat:
> "Read PROJECT_BRIEF.md and docs/sprint-N/progress.md.
>  Continue from where it left off."

```

## Deferred Items Tracker

Create `docs/sprint-N/deferred.md` at sprint start:

```markdown
# Sprint N — Deferred Items

> Items cut, simplified, or deferred during this sprint. Reviewed at the start of Sprint N+1.

## Deferred Items

| # | Item | Original Task | Reason | Priority | Target Sprint | Status |
|---|------|--------------|--------|----------|---------------|--------|
|   |      |              |        |          |               |        |

> If nothing was deferred, write: "No items were deferred during this sprint."

## Simplifications Made

| # | What Was Simplified | Original Scope | Simplified To | Task # | Reason |
|---|-------------------|---------------|--------------|--------|--------|
|   |                   |               |              |        |        |

> Track features that were built but at reduced scope compared to the original plan.
```

## Cumulative Deferred Backlog

Create `docs/deferred/backlog.md` once (cumulative across sprints):

```markdown
# Deferred Items — Cumulative Backlog

> Master list of all deferred items across all sprints. Updated after every sprint.
> Review this at the start of each sprint during Phase 2 planning.

## Active Backlog

| # | Item | Source Sprint | Reason | Priority | Target Sprint | Status |
